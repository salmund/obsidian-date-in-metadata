 # Insert date and time in metadata
 
 Obsidian plugin allowing to insert the current date and time in YAML frontmatter on file creation (which is otherwise not possible). 
 
 - But how does it differ from using templates?

Templates are cool when you want to create a new file with a keyboard shortcut, but when you create a new file from a markdown link, it doesn't work, and that's where my plugin comes in.

## Demo

See how the date is inserted even after link-based-file-creation.
